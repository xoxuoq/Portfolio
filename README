## 💡 My Experience Building This

Working on this portfolio helped me understand how different frontend technologies come together to create a complete, user-friendly experience. I improved my skills in responsive design and learned how to manage page layout using modern CSS techniques like Grid and Flexbox. JavaScript was used to make the site more dynamic—for example, I implemented features like a sticky header, a responsive menu toggle, and simple animations on scroll.

This project also gave me practical experience with:
- Organizing code files and assets effectively
- Designing user-centric interfaces
- Debugging layout and interaction issues across different screen sizes
